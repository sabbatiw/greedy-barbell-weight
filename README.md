### Example
You are supposed to lift 184 lbs this set, and your bar weighs 45 lbs.

First, the desired weight gets rounded to a weight that can be evenly split
using the lowest weight denomination (often 2.5 lbs).

Then, you get a list of what to put on each size (in the appropriate order).

On each side, you should use:
- 1 x 45 lb plate
- 1 x 25 lb plate

Using the above weights, the total actual load would be 185 lbs.
